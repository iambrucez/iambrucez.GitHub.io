\u201cInvolution \u5185\u5377\u201c and Possible Exit Mechanism The question that I am focusing on is whether \"involution\", a word reflecting the frustration of China's young generation in recent years, is harmful to individuals and the overall society. Moreover, if the answer to the above question is yes, is there any exit mechanism for burnout China's involution generation and whether these mechanisms will be likely to work. I believe there is a need to convince a group of people, who think involution is essentially hard-working, which promotes social progress, that involution is harmful to not only the individual but also the whole society. According to Xiang (2020), the concept of \"involution\" was first applied to the study of social issues, that is, Clifford Geertz found that on the island of Java in Indonesia, agriculture has fallen into a vicious circle, where rice planting is constantly absorbing the new population of Java Island but not giving extra produced amount for each person. In modern China, many college students and young people in the industry use it to refer to irrational internal competition, in which the goal is to compete for limited resources and ultimately lead to a large mismatch between the efforts invested by individuals and the resources obtained. One of the most intuitive examples is the extracurricular tuition in preparing for the Gaokao. All parents hope that their children can be admitted to a good university, which leads their children to improve their ability doing exams through extracurricular tuition classes, let's say, from 600 points to 610 points in the exam. However, the enrollment number and ratio of every university are almost unchanged through the years. With almost all children attending extracurricular tutoring classes, the final admission ratio has remained the same. In other words, the financial resource and the students' effort that every family has put in to increase scores from 600 to 610 can be considered wasted. One might argue that after this kind of involution, the student's overall learning ability has been improved, which is of positive significance for the development of society. Nevertheless, the few extra resources that individual students have obtained in this competition process and the waste of economic resources for extracurricular tuition classes that parents could use elsewhere for consumption or investment are ignored. Involution is often harmful to the whole society as well. During the Qing Dynasty, there was a big population explosion in China. Because of the relatively incorruptible governance and few wars, China's population has grown from 70 million in the Shunzhi period to 400 million in the Daoguang period during nearly two hundred years. Therefore, the population explosion led to a large surplus of the Qing Dynasty, making labor costs extremely low. We all know that the purpose of technological innovation is to reduce labor costs. In the case of a population explosion, all technological innovations based on saving labor will be replaced by cheap labor, and technological innovation lacks an endogenous driving force. The Qing Dynasty was trapped in the involution of agriculture and locked up the economy. On the other side of the earth, during these two hundred years, western countries have entered the industrial society through the Industrial Revolution. Involution can resonate with many people because it gives people a feeling of panic and anxiety, that is, given that resources are limited, everyone is driven by fear and strives for resources as much as possible. The more competition there is, the greater the damage will be caused to personal as well as society's resources. Therefore, as the disadvantage being discussed above, the next question would be how university students and young people in the industry can jump out of involution. Along with the popularity of \"involution\" in China's society, another word has received extensive attention and discussion on the Internet, \"Tang Ping\", which can be directly translated to \"lying flat\" (Wang & Wang, 2021). This is an attitude that instead of sticking to social expectations and persisting in striving, it is better to just lie down and have no desires in life. \"Lying flat\" is especially manifested in behaviors such as giving up marriage, not having children, and not looking for work. Although there are indeed some people who are tired of the competition in involution, being able to \"lay flat\", this is unlikely to be a popular involution exit mechanism because most people in society still don't want to give up any chance to receive a better education, obtain a higher-paid job, and live a financially better life. In real life, when a person finds that his/her classmates or colleagues are participating in the involution, it is difficult for him/her to easily jump out of it. Then, there are other people arguing that to terminate the involution, it is their surroundings but not themselves that need to change, that is, we should condemn those \"involuted kings\" (Liu, 2021), those classmates/colleagues who are working super hard in the study/work to win the competition in involution. After all, it is not your boss who makes you work overtime, but other people who are willing to work overtime; it is not the examination that makes you study hard, but other people who are willing to study; it is not the extracurricular tuition classes that put your child in these classes, but other parents who are willing to send their children to not the extracurricular tuition classes. However, in fact, \"involuted kings\" did not cause involution, but involution forces some people to become \"involuted kings\". Condemn on these people cannot create new extra resources nor set up a new extra resources distribution system, which, therefore, indicates its inability to solve involution. So, is there no solution for involution? I believe it is critical to examine the deep cause for involution. As Xiang (2020) argues, an important prerequisite for the involution of Chinese society today is that there is no differentiation, that everyone is chasing one similar goal. As discussed above, the key assumption of involution is the limited resources so that the classmates/colleges have to work harder to win the competition. In China, the high degree of homogeneity of the mainstream social values has led to the high degree of similarity of the good resources that people often seek, including being admitted to a good university, getting a high-paying job, and so on. The idea that being successful and living a good life is so constrained within being getting these good resources, which seems to have become the default and consistent concept of each Chinese young generation. Even if they don't want to go to work, they still hope that they or their descendants to have a car and a house with an annual salary of one million. This is our collective subconsciousness. However, for an individual self, being in involution is extremely mentally and physically exhausted. We who are caught in it with a very confusing feeling. On the one hand, we hate involution, which creates a strong sense of anxiety, and on the other hand, we have to be a part of it to become successful. Therefore, to break the involution, the whole society needs to break the subconsciousness of high-quality resources. Nowadays, if we do not pursue these high-quality resources, we will be worried and questioned by relatives and friends. The collective subconscious has become an invisible moral pressure that prevents us from quitting. We need to find a way to change everyone's values from only participating in extracurricular tuition classes can a student get into a good university, and only spending all energy in work can an office worker afford a car and house, to that it is not necessary to receive the best education or to get the highest-end cars and houses for one to live a good life. In short, the idea of moral betrayal described by Xiang (2020), where withdrawing from the competition is regarded as a kind of betrayal to parents, should not be encouraged. To do this, it is not enough to change the values of a few individuals alone, while entrepreneurs obviously do not want employees to stop competing with each other to improve performance. Therefore, from my point of view, this change in mainstream social values must be implemented by the state or government. From my observations, China's government is indeed doing something to adjust the mainstream social values as well as setting up new related resources-distribution mechanisms. An official document has just been published in the past few weeks, where the government is trying to reduce the marketization of education and limit the types and scale of extracurricular tuition classes. Although I personally do not support such severe restrictions on the large-scale extracurricular tutoring market at once, it can be seen that the state is looking for ways to reduce the occurrence of involution in Gaokao before China's higher education system getting big enough. For another example, real estate, an important factor that has caused countless workers to participate in involution, is also, under the deliberate regulation of the government, gradually losing its investment value. Hopefully, people will be no longer studying/working so hard for merely one goal, to be admitted into a good university or to get a higher-paid salary to buy a house. In conclusion, from all these thoughts and questions, I show how harmful the involution could be and some possible exit mechanisms with the analysis of why or why not it could be working. Especially, I believe to overcome the society-level involution in China, the state and the government have to play a crucial part in it with their power to break the subconsciousness and change the mainstream social values.

Moreover, if the answer to the above question is yes, is there any exit mechanism for burnout China's involution generation and whether these mechanisms will be likely to work. I believe there is a need to convince a group of people, who think involution is essentially hard-working, which promotes social progress, that involution is harmful to not only the individual but also the whole society. According to Xiang (2020), the concept of \"involution\" was first applied to the study of social issues, that is, Clifford Geertz found that on the island of Java in Indonesia, agriculture has fallen into a vicious circle, where rice planting is constantly absorbing the new population of Java Island but not giving extra produced amount for each person. In modern China, many college students and young people in the industry use it to refer to irrational internal competition, in which the goal is to compete for limited resources and ultimately lead to a large mismatch between the efforts invested by individuals and the resources obtained. One of the most intuitive examples is the extracurricular tuition in preparing for the Gaokao. All parents hope that their children can be admitted to a good university, which leads their children to improve their ability doing exams through extracurricular tuition classes, let's say, from 600 points to 610 points in the exam. However, the enrollment number and ratio of every university are almost unchanged through the years. With almost all children attending extracurricular tutoring classes, the final admission ratio has remained the same. In other words, the financial resource and the students' effort that every family has put in to increase scores from 600 to 610 can be considered wasted. One might argue that after this kind of involution, the student's overall learning ability has been improved, which is of positive significance for the development of society. Nevertheless, the few extra resources that individual students have obtained in this competition process and the waste of economic resources for extracurricular tuition classes that parents could use elsewhere for consumption or investment are ignored. Involution is often harmful to the whole society as well. During the Qing Dynasty, there was a big population explosion in China. Because of the relatively incorruptible governance and few wars, China's population has grown from 70 million in the Shunzhi period to 400 million in the Daoguang period during nearly two hundred years. Therefore, the population explosion led to a large surplus of the Qing Dynasty, making labor costs extremely low. We all know that the purpose of technological innovation is to reduce labor costs. In the case of a population explosion, all technological innovations based on saving labor will be replaced by cheap labor, and technological innovation lacks an endogenous driving force. The Qing Dynasty was trapped in the involution of agriculture and locked up the economy. On the other side of the earth, during these two hundred years, western countries have entered the industrial society through the Industrial Revolution. Involution can resonate with many people because it gives people a feeling of panic and anxiety, that is, given that resources are limited, everyone is driven by fear and strives for resources as much as possible. The more competition there is, the greater the damage will be caused to personal as well as society's resources. Therefore, as the disadvantage being discussed above, the next question would be how university students and young people in the industry can jump out of involution. Along with the popularity of \"involution\" in China's society, another word has received extensive attention and discussion on the Internet, \"Tang Ping\", which can be directly translated to \"lying flat\" (Wang & Wang, 2021). This is an attitude that instead of sticking to social expectations and persisting in striving, it is better to just lie down and have no desires in life. \"Lying flat\" is especially manifested in behaviors such as giving up marriage, not having children, and not looking for work. Although there are indeed some people who are tired of the competition in involution, being able to \"lay flat\", this is unlikely to be a popular involution exit mechanism because most people in society still don't want to give up any chance to receive a better education, obtain a higher-paid job, and live a financially better life. In real life, when a person finds that his/her classmates or colleagues are participating in the involution, it is difficult for him/her to easily jump out of it. Then, there are other people arguing that to terminate the involution, it is their surroundings but not themselves that need to change, that is, we should condemn those \"involuted kings\" (Liu, 2021), those classmates/colleagues who are working super hard in the study/work to win the competition in involution. After all, it is not your boss who makes you work overtime, but other people who are willing to work overtime; it is not the examination that makes you study hard, but other people who are willing to study; it is not the extracurricular tuition classes that put your child in these classes, but other parents who are willing to send their children to not the extracurricular tuition classes. However, in fact, \"involuted kings\" did not cause involution, but involution forces some people to become \"involuted kings\". Condemn on these people cannot create new extra resources nor set up a new extra resources distribution system, which, therefore, indicates its inability to solve involution. So, is there no solution for involution? I believe it is critical to examine the deep cause for involution. As Xiang (2020) argues, an important prerequisite for the involution of Chinese society today is that there is no differentiation, that everyone is chasing one similar goal. As discussed above, the key assumption of involution is the limited resources so that the classmates/colleges have to work harder to win the competition. In China, the high degree of homogeneity of the mainstream social values has led to the high degree of similarity of the good resources that people often seek, including being admitted to a good university, getting a high-paying job, and so on. The idea that being successful and living a good life is so constrained within being getting these good resources, which seems to have become the default and consistent concept of each Chinese young generation. Even if they don't want to go to work, they still hope that they or their descendants to have a car and a house with an annual salary of one million. This is our collective subconsciousness. However, for an individual self, being in involution is extremely mentally and physically exhausted. We who are caught in it with a very confusing feeling. On the one hand, we hate involution, which creates a strong sense of anxiety, and on the other hand, we have to be a part of it to become successful. Therefore, to break the involution, the whole society needs to break the subconsciousness of high-quality resources. Nowadays, if we do not pursue these high-quality resources, we will be worried and questioned by relatives and friends. The collective subconscious has become an invisible moral pressure that prevents us from quitting. We need to find a way to change everyone's values from only participating in extracurricular tuition classes can a student get into a good university, and only spending all energy in work can an office worker afford a car and house, to that it is not necessary to receive the best education or to get the highest-end cars and houses for one to live a good life. In short, the idea of moral betrayal described by Xiang (2020), where withdrawing from the competition is regarded as a kind of betrayal to parents, should not be encouraged. To do this, it is not enough to change the values of a few individuals alone, while entrepreneurs obviously do not want employees to stop competing with each other to improve performance. Therefore, from my point of view, this change in mainstream social values must be implemented by the state or government. From my observations, China's government is indeed doing something to adjust the mainstream social values as well as setting up new related resources-distribution mechanisms. An official document has just been published in the past few weeks, where the government is trying to reduce the marketization of education and limit the types and scale of extracurricular tuition classes. Although I personally do not support such severe restrictions on the large-scale extracurricular tutoring market at once, it can be seen that the state is looking for ways to reduce the occurrence of involution in Gaokao before China's higher education system getting big enough. For another example, real estate, an important factor that has caused countless workers to participate in involution, is also, under the deliberate regulation of the government, gradually losing its investment value. Hopefully, people will be no longer studying/working so hard for merely one goal, to be admitted into a good university or to get a higher-paid salary to buy a house. In conclusion, from all these thoughts and questions, I show how harmful the involution could be and some possible exit mechanisms with the analysis of why or why not it could be working.

Introduction - \u2018What-Why-How\u2019 This project is trying to take a glance into ethical concerns in the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market. We want to explore the distribution of attributes and prices on CryptoPunk, one of the most popular NFT projects around the world, via 5 data visualizations. Then, we will use the \u201cWhat-Why-How\u201d framework to further introduce our project. What: What is our visualization dataset? Our dataset includes two parts. First, we collected the CryptoPunk attribution dataset and its on-chain transaction data. We applied a lot of processing to this dataset, shaping it into different structures to make further visualization. The second one is the dataset including more than 50000+ tweets related to NFT Ethic topics that we scrawled from Twitter using the Python Snscrape library. In addition, we also carried out a semantic analysis on this huge data set. We will make all of our datasets open source and share them with cutting-edge researchers and enthusiasts worldwide. Why: Why do we focus on this topic? Non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on the blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique [3]. With the rising price of NFT assets, more and more players have entered this field. However, we observed potential ethical concerns. For example, in the CryptoPunk collection, punks with different genders and skin colors have significantly different prices. Also, we believe that there are inequalities that arise in the generating process of some NFT collections. Therefore, we hope to understand these situations through data exploration, analysis, and ultimately using data visualization methods to present them to a wider audience and the general public. How: How do we achieve the goals and visualize the data? Our research pipeline is from shallow to deep. We will first observe the distribution of each gender and racial factor in the Cryptopunk collection. Then, we will dive into the NFT marketplace to see the transaction situation. Finally, we will analyze the Twitter data to see the public\u2019s ideas on the NFT ethics topic. The visualization design idioms are shown below. 2. Method - Data Processing and Visualization We used DeepNote [1], a data science collaborative data science notebook, to complete our data preparation and processing part. Data Collection: First, our CryptoPunk transaction data is collected from Dune [2], a blockchain analyst tool. We used the data query API in DuneAnalytics to acquire the CryptoPunk transaction data. Second, we applied the Snscrape tool to scrawl related twitter data. The related topic keyword includes: ['NFT', 'CryptoPunk', 'ethic', 'informed consent, 'transparency', 'accountability', 'privacy', 'fairness', 'trust', 'gender', 'ethnicity', 'skin tone', 'skin color'] . Data Cleaning and Engineering: For the CryptoPunk transaction data, we applied the Python Pandas and Numpy library to process the data based on the raw dataset. We divided the original into three parts - Transaction Database, CryptoPund Database, and Trader Database. We restructured the dataframe into these three designed databases, and we renamed the columns for further analysis. For the Twitter data, we filtered out the tweets with at least 5 likes. Then we restructured and renamed the data columns for further analysis. Data Visualization: Our visualization pipeline is from shallow to deep: The distribution of each gender and racial factor in the Cryptopunk collection >>> The transaction situation in NFT Marketplace. >>> Use sentiment analysis for the Twitter data to see the public\u2019s ideas on the NFT ethics topic. A detailed introduction to the visualizations will be shown in the following paragraphs. 3. Result - Description for Each Visualization 3.1 Sankey Diagram The Sankey diagram visualizes the distribution of CryptoPunk with different attributes. We categorized CryptoPunk attributes into 4 levels, Type, Gender, Skin Tone, and # of Accessories, and each column of the diagram represents one level respectively. Users can hover on the flow between two nodes to get the number of CryptoPunks of the two attributes that the nodes represent. Users can drag the node to reorganize the diagram 3.2 Time River Chart Time river depicts the price changing of CryptoPunks with different attributes. We chooses 8 categories of CryptoPunks, which from top to bottom are [ 'Male_Albino', 'Male_Light','Male_Medium', 'Male_Dark','Female_Albino', 'Female_Light', 'Female_Medium', 'Female_Dark'] Users can hover over the figure and get the exact prices of those 8 categories of CryptoPunks on the market at that time. Users can click the labels above to select the categories to be shown. 3.3 Scatter Plot The scatter plot visualizes the CryptoPunks transactions in terms of the punk skin tone of each transaction. Each circle represents a transaction, whose color refers to the punk skin tone of the transaction. Users can zoom in by drawing an area on the figure. Users can hover on the particular dot to get the punk image and its transaction date. Users can click the legends on the top right to select which punk skin tone of the transactions to be shown. 3.4 Circular Network The circular network visualizes the transaction network of CryptoPunk by year. Each node refers to a trader who has participated in at least one transaction of CryptoPunk, and each edge refers to a transaction with the color representing the punk skin tone of the transaction. Users can zoom in to see the network in more detail. Users can select which year the transactions took place by selecting from the drop-down menu. Users can click the legends on the top right to select which punk skin tone of the transactions to be shown. 3.5 Bar Chart & Word Cloud The visualization of the bar chart and WordCloud reflects the sentiments of Twitter users towards NFT ethics-related topics. Users can hover on each section of the bar chart to get the WordCloud image of tweets from the specific year and sentiment results by sentiment analysis. Users can click the legends on the left to select the sentiment percentage to be shown. 4. Discussion - Evaluation and Reflection In order to give our project a well-rounded evaluation and reflection section, we will then explain it in two aspects. Pros: The biggest advantage of our project is innovation and creativity. We included rich interaction design in our visualizations. Users can click the labels to choose to view different types of data, zoom in and out to see the whole or the micro, and click to get the introduction and pictures of punk directly. These various and exciting interactions can enable the users to have a wonderful experience. Besides, we carefully selected the color and channel for each visualization, we believe they can be fairly efficient and friendly to the users. Cons: When we added more innovative and interactive elements to the visualizations, they became a little more complicated. For the general public, it may take a little time to learn about NFT and get used to these advanced visualizations. 5. Conclusion NFT is a very hot and popular market right now, and the number of players is growing rapidly. However, as we discussed in the introduction section, the NFT market currently presents potential ethical and fairness issues. In our project, we successfully collected and processed data about market transactions and Twitter discussions. In addition, we use five highly interactive visualizations to expose and demonstrate these potential ethical and equity issues to the public. Our visualizations demonstrate that different levels of gender and racial inequality have emerged both during the creation and trading stages of Cryptopunk. The number of Cryptopunk is unevenly distributed by gender and race, and the market price varies according to gender and race. Our project, as a pioneer in this field, will resonate with the community and more players. In addition, our project will inspire more researchers to join us and study the ethical issues of blockchain. We plan to continue our research on NFT ethics after this project and provide ethical fairness suggestions and guidance to NFT designers, the Ethereum community, and more blockchain players.

He originally studied mechanical engineering and pursued a Ph.D. in the field of medical engineering. He\u2019s always been interested in novel applications and interdisciplinary fields, recently motivating him to enter the blockchain space. Currently, he\u2019s working as a Junior Analyst, researching blockchain applications with a focus on the Internet Computer Protocol. Opening Remark Prof. Luyao Zhang: Today, we are very glad to have Dr. Dustin Becker here for our AMA interview. Dr. Dustin Becker recently joined Bochsler Finance, \u200b\u200bZ\u00fcrich Switzerland, after completing the postdoc at ETH Z\u00fcrich. Currently, he is working as a junior analyst researching blockchain applications, focusing on Internet Computer protocol (IPC). We are very much looking forward to hearing his insights on blockchain and Internet Computer. Today with me, we have Yufan and Zichao, who are the leaders for the SciEcon NFT Research Lab. Then let\u2019s start our interview. Questions 1 Zichao: We noticed that you focused on medical engineering for doctoral studies at ETH based on your LinkedIn profile. What interests you in the blockchain world, and what motivates you to become an analyst at Bochsler Finance Solution and a Researcher at ICP Global Fund? Dr. Dustin: I really enjoy working in this cutting-edge kind of field where you have no inhibitions taking place. As you already said, I just very recently actually entered into the blockchain space \u2014 it must have already been at the beginning of November. Therefore, everything is also pretty new for me, and very exciting so far. In fact, before entering full-time into blockchain and starting at Bochsler Finance, I was already following along the blockchain space for a couple of years. Thus, it\u2019s not entirely new for me, but I\u2019ve been doing it mainly on a hobby- and investment-side, following along with what\u2019s been going on. When I finished my Ph.D. and was working as a postdoc, I had been thinking a lot about what I wanted to do and how I wanted to continue my career. I realized that I really enjoy working in this cutting-edge kind of field where you have no inhibitions taking place. I have enough interest in the blockchain personally, and this field could be my possible career paths. Therefore, I ended up finding the advertisement for this job application. Somehow I ended up here \u2014 I never expected this, but this is a great opportunity. So far, I am quite enjoying it. It\u2019s a very interesting field and an exciting work environment to be in. Questions 2 Yufan: After many years of rapid growth in the blockchain industry, NFTs rose rapidly at the beginning of this year. As a junior analyst at Bochsler Finance, which is an asset manager specializing in the blockchain industry and decentralized finance, what do you think about the current NFT market in terms of the most significant flaws and weaknesses and its possible future development? Dr. Dustin: While the boom of NFT has a lot of opportunities, it also always brings along fraudsters. The NFT marketplace right now is quite similar to the ICO boom four years ago, where you had a lot of different projects coming up with a lot of ideas. Many ideas and projects were great but a lot were also not very well-founded, and people just popped up websites trying to get funding for the ICO, and then never delivered on their promises. This is also the risk right now within the whole NFT market, which is booming and hype right now. It has a lot of very cool possible applications and a lot of opportunities while this also always brings along fraudsters, who try to take advantage of this. This is certainly a significant risk of NFT. People have to know what kind of projects they are getting into, and the risk of falling for certain fraud exists. Moreover, when getting an NFT, it is not easy to know whether you\u2019re not buying a counterfeit copy or an original one. This is certainly a risk, but luckily there are also solutions to this, at least for certain aspects. For example, Origyn, which is also developed on the IC layer, is going to do the KYC of the customers and the artist. Therefore, it can actually prove who you are as a person, which can also reduce the risks of people misusing the system. I think it always has pros and cons, but this is a way to approach this. It is an ongoing debate on the topic of regulation on cryptocurrency. Other risks with NFTs like money-laundering make it very easy for people to misuse the whole system. For example, suppose you have set up two accounts, you can buy an NFT cheaply, and then buy it from yourself for a much larger amount. You can just say that this is how I earned this money. This situation is certainly an aspect that is also quite risky. These stories come up, and it always puts a bad light on the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFT space. Therefore, NFT certainly also needs some form of regulations and a possible solution to this is KYC. The whole topic of regulation is very tricky right now in cryptocurrency because there\u2019s not much regulation in place yet \u2014 it\u2019s an ongoing debate. For example, the US congress is continuously discussing on how to regulate blockchain and cryptocurrencies.There\u2019s certainly some regulation needed in the future and we will see where this will takeus, but this will also bring more certainty and reduce the risks for the whole NFT space in the future. Zichao: What do you think about the marketplace\u2019s popularity now? Do you think the rapid growth of the NFT market will keep going? If so, for how long? Dr. Dustin: If I knew this, then I could make a lot of money, but I guess nobody knows. It\u2019s a hype and a big boom right now, which certainly will not go on like this forever. There will be a correction at some point or maybe it goes on for a lot longer. Like I said, I just recently started and I\u2019m certainly no expert. I also don\u2019t have a crystal ball where I can look into the future. Questions 3 Zichao: Besides Ethereum \u2014 the birthplace of NFT, many other blockchains also built NFT functions. For example, Polygon, Flow, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, etc. What do you think are the pros and cons of developing NFT on various blockchains, especially compared to the developer experience, efficiency, scalability, and security on the Internet Computer? Dr. Dustin: A big problem that some of the blockchains have is scalability. I have limited experience developing on any blockchain really. From my understanding, so far, it\u2019s really a big problem that some of the blockchains have is simply the scalability. Many blockchains are trying to solve this, especially with the immense gas fees of Ethereum. However, I haven\u2019t developed on these other blockchains. Currently, I\u2019m learning a bit of Motoko on the Internet Computer but I don\u2019t know about the specifics of the other blockchains. However, the big difference that I see, especially so far with developing NFTs on the Internet Computer compared to other ones, is where the asset of the NFTs is actually stored. One part of all the other NFT marketplaces on the other chains, at least what I saw so far, is that the asset itself of an NFT is stored on the classical web and on multiple web services, or IPFS services. You want to have complete Web3.0 applications instead of compromising on storing certain parts of it on the classical web and then having only the NFT metadata identified basically on the blockchain. It is essential to have everything decentralized. Internet Computer gives you the advantages of removing the dependency on other platforms and hosting the entire application on the blockchain The big advantage with ICP is that you can actually have everything on the Internet Computer itself. In other words, there is no need for other platforms because the Internet Computer has the capability of storing the whole asset in certain canisters. Also, the fact that you can actually have the full application, including the front-end hosting on the Internet Computer, is a big difference compared to the other platforms and blockchains. I haven\u2019t seen another blockchain where you can actually host the entire application on the blockchain so far. One actually has to have the front-end in the classical web or some in-web services. Therefore, this is a huge advantage of the Internet Computer regarding scalability and security because everything is decentralized in the end. Regarding developer experience, Dfinity is trying to make it simple for developers because they\u2019re introducing their own language Motoko. Additionally, having the ability to program or develop in Rust makes it quite convenient for new developers to onboard. With me learning Motoko right now, it\u2019s quite interesting. It\u2019s a different type of language for me to learn, but so far, I find it\u2019s very intuitive. Many developers are also working on making tools to make developers\u2019 experience on IC more efficient and more convenient. Many tools will come up in the future and a whole ecosystem will evolve in the next couple of months and years. Questions 4 Yufan: Having a sustainable business model that benefits all stakeholders is the guarantee for the long-term popularity of the blockchain ecosystem. Developers are an essential component of stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem. How does the current business model in the NFT ecosystem benefit developers, and what are your thoughts on the current limitations and future development? Dr. Dustin: The NFT royalties give developers an incentive as a long-term revenue stream. I think you can group this into two parts, especially regarding NFTs. Developers can also be the creators of these NFTs because the NFTs can be artistic work, like classical artists\u2019 work. There\u2019s also a lot of digital artwork created by software developers or applications that can also be an NFT. A big benefit, of course, here is the concept of royalties. When you are a creator or developer developing some sort of NFT, which gets into the secondary market, there is a long-term revenue stream for these developers. Thus, this is really an incentive also for developers or creators to create their creative new types of NFTs. Having DAO structures gives every developer, no matter what kind of hierarchy, a voice in the end. Another benefit for developers working on ICP or other applications is basically that you have the tokenization of these various applications and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) [1]\u2019s forming around these. You then have a direct stake or share of the application you\u2019re developing. Therefore, if you\u2019re a motivated and creative developer, you can put in a lot of effort to develop a nice platform and as you have a personal stake in it, you have a personal incentive for it to become successful. Also, the fact of having these DAO formations, in the end, gives every developer, no matter what kind of hierarchy, a voice. Let\u2019s take the example of NNS (Network Nervous System) [2] on the Internet Computer that everybody can bring up proposals on how to improve the whole ecosystem. In that case, you won\u2019t have to climb up the ladder in hierarchy, as in certain classical businesses, to bring up your ideas and proposals. Everyone can simply post the proposal to the forum or the NNS. This is really a remodeling of every developer and every person involved in the ecosystem. They can bring up ideas and have a voice, which is a huge benefit and something that differentiates from classical business structures. Relevant Materials [1] Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) What is DAO? A DAO is an organization run by a group of people with no typical company hierarchy, who establish their own rules and make decisions based on smart contracts on a blockchain. All its rules and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, thereby removing the need for any central entity. How does DAO relate to NFTs? DAOs help the NFT industry by collective ownership of an asset. Another key area where DAOs help NFTs is community governance. [2] Network Nervous System (NNS) What is NNS? The Network Nervous System (NNS) is the open algorithmic system governing the Internet Computer blockchain. Its most notable innovations include its ability to upgrade the Internet Computer protocol and software running on node machines, onboard new node providers, add node machines into the blockchain network, and create new subnet blockchains to increase capacity. How does NNS work? Anyone can participate in the NNS by staking ICP tokens into one or more neurons. Neurons can submit proposals and decide to adopt or reject them. The NNS implements liquid democracy: neurons can follow other neurons and delegate voting power.

Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is judged as one of the most interesting ideas in Machine Learning in recent years. It described an innovative unsupervised learning method that can generate highly indistinguishable statistics as the original dataset by making two networks contesting with each other. Since its publication, the GAN has drawn a lot of attention from researchers and engineers who are continuously contributing to the optimization and applications of this new machine learning technique. New variations emerge in recent years. In this report, we primarily focus on the original GAN theory that was put forward in 2014 and replicate an optimized Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network structure (DCGAN) to showcase one of its application of generating fabricated images of cats and CryptoPunks using collected dataset. 1.2 Generative and Discriminative Model The GAN falls in the framework of Generative Model. It is in the contrast to the concept of \u201cDiscrim- inative Model\u201d which focuses on choosing the decision boundary between data, while the \u201cGenerative Model\u201d intends to describe the probability distribution of a dataset. This makes generative models harder to be trained. For example, discriminative model can directly draw one hyperplane in the data space to divide two clusters but the generative model has to generate the probability distribution throughout the whole data space. Mathematically, discriminative model tries to learn the conditional probability distribution of p(Y |X) where Y denotes the labels and X denotes the predictor. But generative model tries to learn the joint probability of p(X, Y ) with the help of Bayes Theorem. For the unsupervised learning tasks where there\u2019s no labels Y , it directly learns the probability distribution of p(X). Before the GAN, there was already a family of generative models including Fully Visible Belief Network'' \\cite{frey_hinton_dayan_1995}, Boltzmann Machines'' \\cite{hinton2007boltzmann}, and ``Variational Autoencoders'' \\cite{kingma_welling_2013}. What motivated the author to innovate the GAN was that these models usually involved the Markov Chain which has a higher computational cost and does not perform well in high dimensional spaces \\cite{goodfellow2016nips}. The GAN shows its efficiency via the adversarial approach as described below. 1.3 Adversarial Approach The adversarial approach is the highlight of the GAN and is taking inspiration from the Game Theory. The GAN acts like a ``Zero-sum Non-cooperative Game''. It describes a Minimax Game where two competitors are trying to maximize their own interest and minimizing the other's interest by all means. And through this process, GAN parallelly trains two neural networks to compete and finally the model will learn to generate results which are hard to distinguish whether real or fake. This is especially powerful when dealing with image and audio data, and it also shows a good result in practice. 2 Model GANs are deep generative models with adversarial nets. Each of them contains a generator $G$ who generates new data, and a discriminator $D$ who estimates the data generated by $G$ with some given datasets to give feedback for $G$. It operates a minimax game where the generator and discriminator learn from each other and thus both sides are trained to be stronger. It finally produces new data that could be taken as real. This section generally uses Goodfellow's paper on GAN \\cite{goodfellow_pouget-abadie_mirza_xu_warde-farley_ozair_courville_bengio_2014}, Google Developers \\cite{google_developers_2019}, and Radford's paper on DCGAN \\cite{radford_metz_chintala_2015}, as the references. 2.1 A General Picture A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator $G$, and a discriminator $D$. Generator $G$: Initially, the generator takes a random noise as its input and generate data; In the training process, the generator takes the feedback from the discriminator and upates itself to generate indistinguishable data. Discriminator $D$: The discriminator takes the real data and generated data as its input and do classification to determine the probability that the generated data is real, and give feedback to the generator. For a generative task, in terms of the functionalities of the two components, a GAN model acts in 4 steps before the training process. Figure 1 shows the first two steps of a GAN model.","title":"A Glance into Generative Adversarial Network"},{"location":"Innovate/GAN/#a-glance-into-generative-adversarial-network","text":"Author: Junkai Man , Xinyu Tian, Yufan Zhang & Zesen Zhuang Insturctor: Prof. Elchanan Solomon December 2021, Duke Kunshan University","title":"A Glance into Generative Adversarial Network"},{"location":"Innovate/GAN/#1-goal","text":"","title":"1 Goal"},{"location":"Innovate/GAN/#11-introduction","text":"Initially proposed by Ian J.

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), records on a blockchain that represents pieces of digital media, have become extremely popular this year. NFT marketplaces around the world play a vital role in the trading and liquidity of NFTs. This article introduces what to consider when choosing an NFT marketplace for listing and buying NFTs for your purpose. The currently existing NFT marketplaces worldwide often provide several different features and are built for distinct usage scenarios. Therefore, depending on the position in the NFT marketplace, you need to consider some things when choosing an NFT marketplace. NFT Marketplaces NFT marketplaces are online platforms built on the blockchain ( Ethereum [1] in most cases) for NFTs to be displayed and traded. Sellers, like digital artists, can sell their NFTs on the NFT marketplaces. Buyers and collectors are able to browse and purchase the desired NFT primarily through bidding on the NFT marketplaces. To use an NFT marketplace, one must have a crypto wallet to complete transactions and store their currency. According to data from DappRadar , there are over 30 active NFT marketplaces currently in the world. The number of NFT marketplaces for exchanging digital assets will be expected to rise with the popularity of NFTs. Also, the NFT marketplaces will become increasingly fragmented in the long run, and competition among them will become more intense. Depending on your position in the NFT trading, i.e. whether you are an artist or a digital artwork collector, here are the features you need to consider when choosing the best NFT marketplace that suits your needs. For Artists: Types of NFT Marketplaces The NFT marketplaces can be divided into two categories: the open marketplaces, where anyone can freely join as a creator, and the closed marketplaces, where only invited users, even companies, are allowed to register as creators. Unless you are a very famous digital artist, it is ideal to develop your career as an NFT artist through minting and selling on the open marketplaces and then preparing to be invited into a closed platform. Some NFT marketplaces (such as OpenSea ) are platforms that operate as open markets for all types of NFTs. As an open market NFT artist, you may face issues regarding exposure. In other words, compared with other closed communities, the exposure of NFT will decrease due to too many registered users. In the closed marketplaces, NFT artists can only mint and sell NFTs only if they are invited to enter the market. For example, as the most well-known closed marketplace, Foundation has been running on a mechanism called \u201c Community Upvote \u201d, providing artists with the opportunity to vote among themselves, where the top 50 artists with the highest number of votes can enter the community as creators. In addition, some NFT markets focus on narrower categories. The most famous is NBA Top Shot , which only sells basketball highlights as a virtual trading card. Fees for NFT Minting The process of the creation of NFTs is essential for artists. Similar to the process of creating coins through minting, adding NFT to the blockchain is called minting. Minting refers to the process of turning digital artwork into a part of the blockchain. Therefore, the NFTs of digital art is immutable. It is worth noting that after minting your NFT, it usually enters your wallet, which means you can cast on one marketplace and sell on another. Minting Techniques Using some minting techniques the marketplace might offer NFT creators more choices on the minting fees. For example, the minting technique, lazy minting, can postpone the gas fee for minting NFT until it is sold to its first buyer. In other words, the gas fee for minting is included in the same transaction that assigns the NFT to the buyer, so the NFT creator never has to pay the minting fee. Lazy minting has been adopted by some marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Rarible , which lowers the barriers to entry for artists and NFT creators. According to data from Rarible Analytics , before Rarible introduced lazy minting, the average gas fee of a single ERC-721 token minted on Rarible was 0.022 ETH, which was approximately equivalent to the US $82.26. The introduction of lazy minting makes it possible for artists to make NFTs at zero cost. Blockchain The blockchain(s) that the NFT marketplaces are operating on also plays a crucial part in the NFT minting. Ethereum is the first decentralized blockchain technology to introduce NFT into the crypto world, on which most current NFT marketplaces are built. However, NFT transactions on Ethereum can be considered relatively expensive in terms of gas fees for smaller transactions. Several adjacent blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygan (Matic), and Tron , compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), have been developed to optimize NFT transactions. Let\u2019s take Polygan as an example. Matic, which was later renamed Polygon, was developed to solve the scaling problem of Ethereum. Polygon\u2019s current scaling solution includes the Plasma chain, which allows users to transfer transactions from the main chain to the sub-chains to achieve fast and cheap transactions, and the PoS chain, which has its own proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to protect decentralization. In general, Polygon uses a combination of Plasma and PoS, on the premise of sharing security with Ethereum, to improve efficiency and ensure the security of transactions. In terms of transaction fees, Polygon\u2019s transaction fees are about $0.00004-$0.00012, which is far lower than the gas fee on Ethereum. As gas fees on Ethereum continue to rise, more NFT creators are turning to Polygan. In late August, the NFT social network Showtime announced that its users could mint NFTs on Polygon for free. This new feature of the platform became welcomed by many crypto artists to use Showtime. The gas fee-free NFT minting on Showtime using Polygan can be sold on OpenSea. NFT Royalties and Token Standards NFT transactions, unlike traditional art transactions, allow artists to be paid through their sales and the royalties they may receive from subsequent sales. With blockchain technology, which allows secure traceability, secondary market sales are possible. According to data from NFT tracker NonFungible , more buyers and higher dollar volume are participating in the secondary market for NFTs. NFT royalties give the creator a certain percentage of the sale price each time the NFT is sold on the marketplace. The use of smart contracts will enable authors to obtain a share of the sales price automatically and immediately. Imagine you have created an NFT artwork on an NFT marketplace such as Rarible. A buyer purchased it for 8 ETH. Therefore, you obtained 8 ETH (Ethereum). Suppose you also enter a 10% royalty in the minting of this NFT, that is, whenever a sale occurs, you will get 10% of the revenue. Now, your buyers are auctioning your artwork at a higher price in the market. As your reputation improves, another buyer might buy it for 300 ETH. Since you have pre-coded 10% of the royalties into the NFT, you will receive 30 ETH from this sale. The token standard also influences the creator\u2019s royalty in terms of cross-marketplace transactions. Not all NFT marketplaces utilize the same token standards as we have discussed in the last article. Commonly-used token standards include ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-998. Understanding the token standards that underlie the NFTs will help users understand the different use scenarios of each type of NFT and the various blockchain protocols involved. For instance, Mintable only supports NFTs built with ERC-721 standards, while OpenSea supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155. The ERC-721 standard is now being revised to allow a more efficient method of payment of royalties. It aims to solve the problem of payment of copyright fees when NFT cross-marketplace transactions. The ERC-721 standard will support royalty fees transactions that do not depend on the marketplace on which the NFT is minted. For Collectors: Categories of NFTs The first thing to consider is the categories of NFT. Depending on what category of digital assets you plan to seek, there are NFT marketplaces with different mechanisms for you to search for and buy NFT. If you are a sports fan, the NBA Top Shot and Sorare are two of the most famous NFT marketplaces. The former is for selling digital trading cards of NBA players. The latter is a football game with collectable NFT cards. For digital artwork, which is the focus of many NFT marketplaces, Choosing the right marketplace often depends on the rarity and style of the artwork you are seeking. For example, the SuperRare marketplace considers the social aspects of the art collection, described as the \u201cInstagram meets Christie\u2019s\u201d. There are other sorts of NFT marketplace for virtual real estate, such as Decentraland , and for video games, such as Axie Infinity . Blockchain Choosing the appropriate blockchain that the NFT marketplace is built on is very important in many aspects, including scalability, transaction costs, and the degree of decentralization. Except for the Ethereum blockchain that most NFT marketplaces are built on, some other blockchains have been developed with strategies like energy-efficient blockchain transaction validation mechanisms. For example, Flow was developed by Dapper Labs , who are also the developers of CryptoKitties , to achieve a faster decentralized network, empowering the entire decentralized application ecosystem, especially games and digital collectables. NBA Top Shot is one of the NFT marketplaces built on Flow. Payment Methods Another consideration is the payment methods supported by the NFT marketplace. That is, whether it is the case that users can use fiat currency to purchase NFTs in the marketplace or cryptocurrency is required for sales. Moreover, paying with credit cards and debit cards, and some other online payment methods, such as WeChat Pay in China, might be more convenient ways for new users, who might not be very familiar with cryptocurrency, to buy NFTs on the marketplace. Several NFT marketplaces such as SoRare have accepted multiple payment methods, including cryptocurrency, credit card, and debit card. However, many NFT marketplaces, such as Decentraland and SuperRare, still merely support cryptocurrency payment. Popular NFT Marketplaces OpenSea https://miro.medium.com/max/940/0*SbOKQaEb_sgPe23s As the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplace as well as one of the earliest established NFT marketplaces, OpenSea covers a wide range of NFT categories, including digital art, music, domain names, gaming assets, and cards. OpenSea is built on the Ethereum protocol and offers integrated support for the Klaytn and Polygon networks. The NFTs on the OpenSea include ERC721 and ERC1155 assets. OpenSea shares the gas fee more equally between creators and buyers, allowing people with tight budgets to mint NFTs. Features Fees: Lazy minting + 2.5% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Klaytn Token standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155 Supported payment methods: Credit card, Debit card, Cryptocurrency, Bank transfer Creator royalty on the secondary market: Configure up to 10% Rarible https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*Dd8Yqz-g_kH6oTzu Rarible is another popular NFT marketplace globally, whose prominent category of NFTs available is digital art. What is spatial of Rarible compared to OpenSea is the \u201cRARI standard tokens\u201d, which allows the users to mint singles or multiples, add properties, set commission, and choose fixed-price sales and auctions. Rarible is built on Etheruem and uses token standards ERC-721, ERC-1155. Features Fees: Lazy minting + 2.5% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon Token standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155 Supported payment methods: Cryptocurrency Creator royalty on the secondary market: Open-ended Nifty Gateway https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*0XKsf9vKx68iECP5 Nifty Gateway is an NFT auction house and marketplace featuring major artists and creators supported by the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. Nifty Gateway has sold NFTs by Beeple, Grimes, LOGIK, and other famous NFT artists. Nifty Gateway is designed to allow everyone to collect NFT. However, for minting on this marketplace, you must apply. At Nifty Gateway, fiat currency is the most important means of payment. Therefore, this market is not suitable for people who is extremely passionate about Ethereum/DeFi. Features Fees: 20% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum Token standards: ERC-721 Supported payment methods: Credit card primarily, with prepaid ETH for some transactions Creator royalty on the secondary market: 5% Foundation https://miro.medium.com/max/1252/0*FZut_bFXD9662RRK Foundation is an application that facilitates real-time auctions of NFTs. Foundation is exclusive, which means one must be invited by the existing creator of Foundation instead of submitting an application. As we introduced before, Foundation runs on the mechanism of \u201cCommunity Upvote\u201d. The advantage of participating in Foundation lies in its high level. If you are a Foundation artist, collectors will know that you are at this level where your works are more likely to get high value. Features Fees: Gas fees + 15% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum Token standards: ERC-721 Supported payment methods: Cryptocurrency Creator royalty on the secondary market: 10% on Foundation or OpenSea only Conclusion With the upsurge of NFTs, the number and categories of NFT marketplaces are expected to increase in the long run. Many of the current marketplaces are built for certain targeted users with specific purpose such as buying NFT collectives of highlight reels, while some serve a larger group of NFT creators and collectors. Therefore, this article helps you to choose the best NFT marketplace that suits your needs, depending on what your position is in this boom of NFT.
