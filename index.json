[{"content":" 备考背景 需要说明的是，本人是一名昆山杜克大学（Top2 中外合作大学）的准大四学生，由于平常上课、写作业、看文献都是英语，所以相对来说，我并不是一一个纯英语学术小白的身份约考 GRE，有一定的英语学术文献阅读、写作的能力。\n我报考 GRE 的过程比较心酸，我先是约考了去年（2021年）年底在苏州的GRE线下考试，但发现就在期末周结束的周末，迫不得已（实际上是还没背完单词）转考到了来年3月，但因为疫情，那场又被取消，再尔转考5月的苏州线下场，又因为上海的疫情取消，最后确定到了今年的7月25号。\n准确来说，我的备考周期远远不止 20 天。说来惭愧，我从大一暑假学车的时候就开始准备GRE的词汇，但断断续续的背诵，导致一直没有记住多少单词。今年暑假，也就是申请季前的最后一个暑假，约考 7.24 的 DDL 推动我重新开始了备考，当然，是以背诵单词开始。据我在「墨墨背单词」的签到记录，我从今年的 6.13 一直日签到考试日 7.24，背诵下来差不多 3000 GRE 词汇。我所说的备考二十天，应该是我差不多开始突击填空、阅读、数学的时间。\n最后的成绩是V158+Q168+3.5，不算太高，但也将将够用。\n在开始备考之前 我当时并没有这么做，但 I just wish I could do it.\n去看一些关于 GRE 的介绍视频，大概了解GRE的考试过程，也提前看一下每个 section 的例题是怎么样的。比如七选二的本质就是选同义词，这一点看过一个例题就能明白；最好再评估一下，自己的数学水平需不需要再认真备考一下 GRE 数学。我就是在考前两天才开始做数学的机经，但却发现比我想象的要难一些，比如一些数列的知识在学完 Calculus 之后就忘了，更不用说大学之后再也没接触过的几何。\n关于单词 App: 墨墨背单词\n战线一定不能拉太长！战线一定不能拉太长！战线一定不能拉太长！\n就如我在前面所说的，我其实从大一开始就有意识地开始背诵 GRE 的单词，但断断续续的学习状态一点也没有帮助到我。我个人的经验是找出考试前一个半到两个月的时间集中背单词，每天背诵新词至少 100 个，听上去不多，但在每天背 100 个新单词的同时，还要复习大约 400-500 个以前学过的单词，这就意味着每天的单词背诵量达到了 500-600 个，以我的经验来说，这将消耗每天差不多两个小时的时间。\n显而易见，这个过程是非常枯燥且折磨的，尤其是初期和后期，前者的挑战是遇到一个词就不会一个词，往往要花费更多的时间；后者是快要接近考试，但每天复习旧词时仍然没有全都认识，会产生焦虑。我的经验是「摆烂」：不要妄想着当天就要背锅每一个没见过的新词，这是几乎不可能的，就把不认识的单词留给明天的自己吧。过了三四天，你会发现前几天完全没见过的单词也开始有了大概的印象，再过几天，竟然可以成功背下，我猜这也是得益于如今无数个App对于记忆曲线的研究。\n另一个经验是，当我背过差不多 1300-1500 左右的单词时，再往下背，会发现记忆一个新词的难度大概率会下降，因为你背过的单词加上你从小到大学过的单词，给足了你英语中常见单词词根的意思，根据词根推断新词的大概意思、动/名/形容词也不再是个难事。\n再来聊聊背单词的 App，我在大一大二一直在用的KMF的「GRE3000词」App，该 App 的记忆模式是出现一个单词的同时显示四个意思的备选项，这就导致我很自然地会去看可能的选项，进而通过词性、大概的词义来选出正确选项。因此，看似背诵过了很多单词，但大部分时候，如果仅仅给我单词的英文，我是不会想到准确的中文释义的。相比较之下，「墨墨背单词」是指出现单词的英文，要求用户自己选择「认识」「模糊」「忘记」，显然，这种需要我们直接根据英文记起中文的背诵方式更有益于我们的记忆。\n可以 2-3 个好友一起使用「墨墨背单词」中的组队学习功能，一起打卡，在互相督促的同时也可以一起吐槽App中对某些单词的助记。\n关于填空 考前 20 天，去考满分的GRE官网做练习题，从 easy 到 medium 再到 hard。一开始可以不管时间限制，能做对多少是多少。再正确率能达到 8/10 左右时，总结一些做题经验（比如根据含前后对比的句子来选反义词），并且开始注意做题时间。GRE Verbal section 一共20道题、30min，因此一道填空题最好再 1min 之内解决，留出一定时间给阅读。临近考试的 3-4 天，去刷一些近两年的机经，说不定就能碰到原题（我碰到了两道填空）。\n这里要注意一些做题思路了。我的经验是，遇到不确定的或者不认识的选项时，单空题可以纠结一下，多空题纠结的必要性真的不是很大。比如七选二里，你可能在选项里就可以找到两对近义词，你纠结对的概率大约是 1/2。但对于多空题来说，纠结（蒙）对的概率非常之小，倒不如把纠结的时间留给解决后面的题目或者多读几遍阅读的文章。\n关于阅读 仍然是考前 20 天去考满分的GRE官网做练习题，考前 3-4 天做近 1-2 年的机经。我看到网上的经验包括很多GRE的试听课都说的解题思路是，先读题目，再去文中找题干中的关键词定位关键句，在关键句上下寻找答案。就我个人而言，我尝试用这种方法做了几篇文章，并没有很好的效果，而且选出的答案往往让我也非常心虚。我的经验还是速读一遍文章，再去看题目，因为这样可以帮助我首先明白这个文章大概讲了什么，即使细节没有注意到。再在做每个题目的时候细看文章的某一片段。\n有一点我必须要承认，大学学习生活中我需要经常性地阅读英文文献、文档来满足我的课程要求和项目要求，所以我还是在备考 GRE 前就具备了一定的英文阅读能力，所以也许我的做题方法并不适用于每一个人。\n关于数学 千万不要低估GRE数学的难度。正如我前文所讲，网上说的一些“中国人天生170”的说法使我并没有在备考的期间很重视数学部分的学习，直到考前两天才开始做一些机经。看到已经许久没碰到的数列、排列组合、质数和数、几何题时，我差点认为我要凉了。但说实话，只要花一点时间过一下这些内容的知识点，GRE数学的题目确实称不上有挑战性，尤其是对于文理科的、高考数学在 130 以上的同学来说。\n另外值得注意的是，由于本科期间的教育一直是全英文，所以我对那些数学专有名词的英文还算比较熟悉，如果这方面有困难的同学还需要背一下数学的英语词汇:)\n关于写作 由于我准备申请的大部分是理工科的项目，写作一般并不是重点，我也没有多花时间准备。主要了解了一下大概考察的题型和字数要求。\n考试过程中 这点我觉得也应该分享一下。就我个人来说，由于近一年的课要么是 online，要么是 project 没有 exam ，我印象中已经好久没有体验过这种很多人坐在一个屋子里共同竞争考试的场景了。所以考试的当天一开始还是有一点不太适应如此大 pressure 的环境，尤其是有人会提前交卷、提前休息的时候。所以一定要在考试前做好心理准备，准备好忍受全教室的人在写作时敲打的键盘声。\n另外，我考试的顺序是 VQVQV，在第一个 Verbal section 的时候，我估计我的正确率都不到60%，感觉遇到了很多不认识的单词和看不懂的句子。到了第二个V的时候，自我感觉题目难度大幅下降，当时心里还是有点慌的，是不是掉到 easy level 了，但从结果来看，应该还是在 middle level。所以经验就是做完一个 section 就忘记吧，调整好心态再点开下一个section。\n在做数学时，我的经验是一定不要在草稿纸上随便演算，最好标记好哪一块的草稿对应着哪一道题（有点高考内味），把自己不确定的题 mark 一下，最后给自己留出 5-7min 检查的时间。我记得我当时至少通过检查查出了两出计算错误。\n资料 如果你需要的话，我把我用到的一些机经的文档都放在了这个 Google Drive 里 :)\n","permalink":"http://yufanz.xyz/blog/gre/","summary":"备考背景 需要说明的是，本人是一名昆山杜克大学（Top2 中外合作大学）的准大四学生，由于平常上课、写作业、看文献都是英语，所以相对来说，我并不是一一个纯英语学术小白的身份约考 GRE，有一定的英语学术文献阅读、写作的能力。\n我报考 GRE

Accordingly, automatic stylized font generation in a deep learning-based fashion is a desirable but challenging task that has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. This paper revisits the state-of-the-art methods for stylized font generation and presents a taxonomy of the deep learning-based stylized font generation. Despite the notable performance of the existing models, stylized multilingual font generation, the task of applying specific font style to diverse characters in multiple languages has never been reported to be addressed. An efficient and economical method for stylized multilingual font generation is essential in numerous application scenarios that require communication with international audiences. We propose a solution for few-shot multilingual stylized font generation by a fast feed-forward network, Multilingual Font Generation Network (MF-Net), which can transfer previously unseen font styles from a few samples to characters from previously unseen languages. Following the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, MF-Net adopts two separate encoders in the generator to decouple a font image\u0026rsquo;s content and style information. We adopt an attention module in the style encoder to extract both shallow and deep style features. Moreover, we also design a novel language complexity-aware skip connection to adaptive adjust the structural information to be preserved. With an effective loss function to improve the visual quality of the generated font images, we show the effectiveness of the proposed MF-Net based on quantitative and subjective visual evaluation, and compare it with the existing models in the scenario of stylized multilingual font generation.\nNetwork Architecture Overall structure\nLanguage complexity indicator\nGallery Visual comparison of our proposed model and its competitor on seen language.\nVisual comparison of our proposed model and its competitor on unseen language.\n","permalink":"http://yufanz.xyz/project/mfnet/","summary":"Authors: Yufan Zhang, Junkai Man, Peng Sun\nAccepted by ACM Multimedia 2022\nGitHub\nAbstract Creating a complete stylized font library that helps the audience to perceive information from the text often requires years of study and proficiency in the use of many professional tools.

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), records on a blockchain that represents pieces of digital media, have become extremely popular this year. NFT marketplaces around the world play a vital role in the trading and liquidity of NFTs. This article introduces what to consider when choosing an NFT marketplace for listing and buying NFTs for your purpose. The currently existing NFT marketplaces worldwide often provide several different features and are built for distinct usage scenarios. Therefore, depending on the position in the NFT marketplace, you need to consider some things when choosing an NFT marketplace.\nNFT Marketplaces NFT marketplaces are online platforms built on the blockchain (Ethereum[1] in most cases) for NFTs to be displayed and traded. Sellers, like digital artists, can sell their NFTs on the NFT marketplaces. Buyers and collectors are able to browse and purchase the desired NFT primarily through bidding on the NFT marketplaces. To use an NFT marketplace, one must have a crypto wallet to complete transactions and store their currency.\nAccording to data from DappRadar, there are over 30 active NFT marketplaces currently in the world. The number of NFT marketplaces for exchanging digital assets will be expected to rise with the popularity of NFTs. Also, the NFT marketplaces will become increasingly fragmented in the long run, and competition among them will become more intense. Depending on your position in the NFT trading, i.e. whether you are an artist or a digital artwork collector, here are the features you need to consider when choosing the best NFT marketplace that suits your needs.\nFor Artists: Types of NFT Marketplaces The NFT marketplaces can be divided into two categories: the open marketplaces, where anyone can freely join as a creator, and the closed marketplaces, where only invited users, even companies, are allowed to register as creators. Unless you are a very famous digital artist, it is ideal to develop your career as an NFT artist through minting and selling on the open marketplaces and then preparing to be invited into a closed platform.\nSome NFT marketplaces (such as OpenSea) are platforms that operate as open markets for all types of NFTs. As an open market NFT artist, you may face issues regarding exposure. In other words, compared with other closed communities, the exposure of NFT will decrease due to too many registered users. In the closed marketplaces, NFT artists can only mint and sell NFTs only if they are invited to enter the market. For example, as the most well-known closed marketplace, Foundation has been running on a mechanism called “Community Upvote”, providing artists with the opportunity to vote among themselves, where the top 50 artists with the highest number of votes can enter the community as creators. In addition, some NFT markets focus on narrower categories. The most famous is NBA Top Shot, which only sells basketball highlights as a virtual trading card.\nFees for NFT Minting The process of the creation of NFTs is essential for artists. Similar to the process of creating coins through minting, adding NFT to the blockchain is called minting. Minting refers to the process of turning digital artwork into a part of the blockchain. Therefore, the NFTs of digital art is immutable. It is worth noting that after minting your NFT, it usually enters your wallet, which means you can cast on one marketplace and sell on another.\nMinting Techniques Using some minting techniques the marketplace might offer NFT creators more choices on the minting fees. For example, the minting technique, lazy minting, can postpone the gas fee for minting NFT until it is sold to its first buyer. In other words, the gas fee for minting is included in the same transaction that assigns the NFT to the buyer, so the NFT creator never has to pay the minting fee.\nLazy minting has been adopted by some marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Rarible, which lowers the barriers to entry for artists and NFT creators. According to data from Rarible Analytics, before Rarible introduced lazy minting, the average gas fee of a single ERC-721 token minted on Rarible was 0.022 ETH, which was approximately equivalent to the US $82.26. The introduction of lazy minting makes it possible for artists to make NFTs at zero cost.\nBlockchain The blockchain(s) that the NFT marketplaces are operating on also plays a crucial part in the NFT minting. Ethereum is the first decentralized blockchain technology to introduce NFT into the crypto world, on which most current NFT marketplaces are built. However, NFT transactions on Ethereum can be considered relatively expensive in terms of gas fees for smaller transactions. Several adjacent blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygan(Matic), and Tron, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), have been developed to optimize NFT transactions.\nLet’s take Polygan as an example. Matic, which was later renamed Polygon, was developed to solve the scaling problem of Ethereum. Polygon’s current scaling solution includes the Plasma chain, which allows users to transfer transactions from the main chain to the sub-chains to achieve fast and cheap transactions, and the PoS chain, which has its own proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to protect decentralization. In general, Polygon uses a combination of Plasma and PoS, on the premise of sharing security with Ethereum, to improve efficiency and ensure the security of transactions. In terms of transaction fees, Polygon’s transaction fees are about $0.00004-$0.00012, which is far lower than the gas fee on Ethereum.\nAs gas fees on Ethereum continue to rise, more NFT creators are turning to Polygan. In late August, the NFT social network Showtime announced that its users could mint NFTs on Polygon for free. This new feature of the platform became welcomed by many crypto artists to use Showtime. The gas fee-free NFT minting on Showtime using Polygan can be sold on OpenSea.\nNFT Royalties and Token Standards NFT transactions, unlike traditional art transactions, allow artists to be paid through their sales and the royalties they may receive from subsequent sales. With blockchain technology, which allows secure traceability, secondary market sales are possible. According to data from NFT tracker NonFungible, more buyers and higher dollar volume are participating in the secondary market for NFTs.\nNFT royalties give the creator a certain percentage of the sale price each time the NFT is sold on the marketplace. The use of smart contracts will enable authors to obtain a share of the sales price automatically and immediately. Imagine you have created an NFT artwork on an NFT marketplace such as Rarible. A buyer purchased it for 8 ETH. Therefore, you obtained 8 ETH (Ethereum). Suppose you also enter a 10% royalty in the minting of this NFT, that is, whenever a sale occurs, you will get 10% of the revenue. Now, your buyers are auctioning your artwork at a higher price in the market. As your reputation improves, another buyer might buy it for 300 ETH. Since you have pre-coded 10% of the royalties into the NFT, you will receive 30 ETH from this sale.\nThe token standard also influences the creator’s royalty in terms of cross-marketplace transactions. Not all NFT marketplaces utilize the same token standards as we have discussed in the last article. Commonly-used token standards include ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-998. Understanding the token standards that underlie the NFTs will help users understand the different use scenarios of each type of NFT and the various blockchain protocols involved. For instance, Mintable only supports NFTs built with ERC-721 standards, while OpenSea supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155. The ERC-721 standard is now being revised to allow a more efficient method of payment of royalties. It aims to solve the problem of payment of copyright fees when NFT cross-marketplace transactions. The ERC-721 standard will support royalty fees transactions that do not depend on the marketplace on which the NFT is minted.\nFor Collectors: Categories of NFTs The first thing to consider is the categories of NFT. Depending on what category of digital assets you plan to seek, there are NFT marketplaces with different mechanisms for you to search for and buy NFT.\nIf you are a sports fan, the NBA Top Shot and Sorare are two of the most famous NFT marketplaces. The former is for selling digital trading cards of NBA players. The latter is a football game with collectable NFT cards. For digital artwork, which is the focus of many NFT marketplaces, Choosing the right marketplace often depends on the rarity and style of the artwork you are seeking. For example, the SuperRare marketplace considers the social aspects of the art collection, described as the “Instagram meets Christie’s”. There are other sorts of NFT marketplace for virtual real estate, such as Decentraland, and for video games, such as Axie Infinity.\nBlockchain Choosing the appropriate blockchain that the NFT marketplace is built on is very important in many aspects, including scalability, transaction costs, and the degree of decentralization. Except for the Ethereum blockchain that most NFT marketplaces are built on, some other blockchains have been developed with strategies like energy-efficient blockchain transaction validation mechanisms. For example, Flow was developed by Dapper Labs, who are also the developers of CryptoKitties, to achieve a faster decentralized network, empowering the entire decentralized application ecosystem, especially games and digital collectables. NBA Top Shot is one of the NFT marketplaces built on Flow.\nPayment Methods Another consideration is the payment methods supported by the NFT marketplace. That is, whether it is the case that users can use fiat currency to purchase NFTs in the marketplace or cryptocurrency is required for sales. Moreover, paying with credit cards and debit cards, and some other online payment methods, such as WeChat Pay in China, might be more convenient ways for new users, who might not be very familiar with cryptocurrency, to buy NFTs on the marketplace.\nSeveral NFT marketplaces such as SoRare have accepted multiple payment methods, including cryptocurrency, credit card, and debit card. However, many NFT marketplaces, such as Decentraland and SuperRare, still merely support cryptocurrency payment.\nPopular NFT Marketplaces OpenSea https://miro.medium.com/max/940/0*SbOKQaEb_sgPe23s\nAs the world’s largest NFT marketplace as well as one of the earliest established NFT marketplaces, OpenSea covers a wide range of NFT categories, including digital art, music, domain names, gaming assets, and cards. OpenSea is built on the Ethereum protocol and offers integrated support for the Klaytn and Polygon networks. The NFTs on the OpenSea include ERC721 and ERC1155 assets. OpenSea shares the gas fee more equally between creators and buyers, allowing people with tight budgets to mint NFTs.\nFeatures Fees: Lazy minting + 2.5% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Klaytn Token standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155 Supported payment methods: Credit card, Debit card, Cryptocurrency, Bank transfer Creator royalty on the secondary market: Configure up to 10% Rarible https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*Dd8Yqz-g_kH6oTzu\nRarible is another popular NFT marketplace globally, whose prominent category of NFTs available is digital art. What is spatial of Rarible compared to OpenSea is the “RARI standard tokens”, which allows the users to mint singles or multiples, add properties, set commission, and choose fixed-price sales and auctions. Rarible is built on Etheruem and uses token standards ERC-721, ERC-1155.\nFeatures Fees: Lazy minting + 2.5% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon Token standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155 Supported payment methods: Cryptocurrency Creator royalty on the secondary market: Open-ended Nifty Gateway https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*0XKsf9vKx68iECP5\nNifty Gateway is an NFT auction house and marketplace featuring major artists and creators supported by the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. Nifty Gateway has sold NFTs by Beeple, Grimes, LOGIK, and other famous NFT artists. Nifty Gateway is designed to allow everyone to collect NFT. However, for minting on this marketplace, you must apply. At Nifty Gateway, fiat currency is the most important means of payment. Therefore, this market is not suitable for people who is extremely passionate about Ethereum/DeFi.\nFeatures Fees: 20% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum Token standards: ERC-721 Supported payment methods: Credit card primarily, with prepaid ETH for some transactions Creator royalty on the secondary market: 5% Foundation https://miro.medium.com/max/1252/0*FZut_bFXD9662RRK\nFoundation is an application that facilitates real-time auctions of NFTs. Foundation is exclusive, which means one must be invited by the existing creator of Foundation instead of submitting an application. As we introduced before, Foundation runs on the mechanism of “Community Upvote”. The advantage of participating in Foundation lies in its high level. If you are a Foundation artist, collectors will know that you are at this level where your works are more likely to get high value.\nFeatures Fees: Gas fees + 15% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum Token standards: ERC-721 Supported payment methods: Cryptocurrency Creator royalty on the secondary market: 10% on Foundation or OpenSea only Conclusion With the upsurge of NFTs, the number and categories of NFT marketplaces are expected to increase in the long run. Many of the current marketplaces are built for certain targeted users with specific purpose such as buying NFT collectives of highlight reels, while some serve a larger group of NFT creators and collectors. Therefore, this article helps you to choose the best NFT marketplace that suits your needs, depending on what your position is in this boom of NFT. We provide a flowchart to guide your decision in figure 10 and figure 11.\n","permalink":"http://yufanz.xyz/project/nftartist/","summary":"Authors: Yufan Zhang, Zichao Chen\nSciEcon NFT Research Lab, SciEcon CIC\nMedium\nIntroduction In the article NFT Marketplace: Introduction to NFT and NFT Marketplace’s Mechanism, we have given you the primary mechanism of NFT and the specialized NFT marketplaces.

It has gained significant momentum worldwide over the last three decades. To fairly evaluate the quality and sustainability of the existing higher education system in different countries, we constructed a Back-Propagation neuro network model. We assess seven representative countries.\nIn the first part, we carefully selected indices including enrollment ratio, Gender Parity Index, the number of Nobel prizes in different countries. Then, we pre-processed our data using normalization and whitening methods, extracting three indices. Based on that, we developed a BPNN(Back Propagation Neuro Network) Evaluation model. Our model uses the extracted indices as input and output the evaluation of the higher education system. Considering the shortcomings of slow convergence speed and low precision of the BP neural network, we used PSO to improve it. Finally, the higher education health grades of the seven countries are obtained.\nSecond, by using time series analysis, we predicted the development of the national higher education system in the seven countries in 2024. The evaluation obtained from this part can be considered as the sustainable evaluation of higher education.\nIn the third part, we analyzed the current situation of higher education and possible targeted policiesinPortugaland propose our suggestionson the basis of part1.\nMoreover, we proved that our model is valid in the fourth part –model assessment. We analyzedthe sensitivity and stability of the model. Besides, we also discussed the strengths and limitations of our model, offered possible solutions to further improve it.\n","permalink":"http://yufanz.xyz/project/higheredu/","summary":"Authors: Qinwanxian Liu, Chenyu Wang, Yufan Zhang\nMeritotious Winner for MCM/ICM 2022\nPDF | Certificate\nAbstract Higher education is a core component of a sustainable society.
