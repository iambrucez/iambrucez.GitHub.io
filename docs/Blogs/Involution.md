# Reflection on “Involution 内卷“ and Possible Exit Mechanism

![involution](../img/blogs/A-involution.jpg)

The question that I am focusing on is whether "involution", a word reflecting the frustration of China's young generation in recent years, is harmful to individuals and the overall society. Moreover, if the answer to the above question is yes, is there any exit mechanism for burnout China's involution generation and whether these mechanisms will be likely to work.

I believe there is a need to convince a group of people, who think involution is essentially hard-working, which promotes social progress, that involution is harmful to not only the individual but also the whole society.

According to Xiang (2020), the concept of "involution" was first applied to the study of social issues, that is, Clifford Geertz found that on the island of Java in Indonesia, agriculture has fallen into a vicious circle, where rice planting is constantly absorbing the new population of Java Island but not giving extra produced amount for each person. In modern China, many college students and young people in the industry use it to refer to irrational internal competition, in which the goal is to compete for limited resources and ultimately lead to a large mismatch between the efforts invested by individuals and the resources obtained.

One of the most intuitive examples is the extracurricular tuition in preparing for the Gaokao. All parents hope that their children can be admitted to a good university, which leads their children to improve their ability doing exams through extracurricular tuition classes, let's say, from 600 points to 610 points in the exam. However, the enrollment number and ratio of every university are almost unchanged through the years. With almost all children attending extracurricular tutoring classes, the final admission ratio has remained the same. In other words, the financial resource and the students' effort that every family has put in to increase scores from 600 to 610 can be considered wasted. One might argue that after this kind of involution, the student's overall learning ability has been improved, which is of positive significance for the development of society. Nevertheless, the few extra resources that individual students have obtained in this competition process and the waste of economic resources for extracurricular tuition classes that parents could use elsewhere for consumption or investment are ignored.

Involution is often harmful to the whole society as well. During the Qing Dynasty, there was a big population explosion in China. Because of the relatively incorruptible governance and few wars, China's population has grown from 70 million in the Shunzhi period to 400 million in the Daoguang period during nearly two hundred years. Therefore, the population explosion led to a large surplus of the Qing Dynasty, making labor costs extremely low. We all know that the purpose of technological innovation is to reduce labor costs. In the case of a population explosion, all technological innovations based on saving labor will be replaced by cheap labor, and technological innovation lacks an endogenous driving force. The Qing Dynasty was trapped in the involution of agriculture and locked up the economy. On the other side of the earth, during these two hundred years, western countries have entered the industrial society through the Industrial Revolution.

Involution can resonate with many people because it gives people a feeling of panic and anxiety, that is, given that resources are limited, everyone is driven by fear and strives for resources as much as possible. The more competition there is, the greater the damage will be caused to personal as well as society's resources.

Therefore, as the disadvantage being discussed above, the next question would be how university students and young people in the industry can jump out of involution.

Along with the popularity of "involution" in China's society, another word has received extensive attention and discussion on the Internet, "Tang Ping", which can be directly translated to "lying flat" (Wang & Wang, 2021). This is an attitude that instead of sticking to social expectations and persisting in striving, it is better to just lie down and have no desires in life. "Lying flat" is especially manifested in behaviors such as giving up marriage, not having children, and not looking for work. Although there are indeed some people who are tired of the competition in involution, being able to "lay flat", this is unlikely to be a popular involution exit mechanism because most people in society still don't want to give up any chance to receive a better education, obtain a higher-paid job, and live a financially better life. In real life, when a person finds that his/her classmates or colleagues are participating in the involution, it is difficult for him/her to easily jump out of it.

Then, there are other people arguing that to terminate the involution, it is their surroundings but not themselves that need to change, that is, we should condemn those "involuted kings" (Liu, 2021), those classmates/colleagues who are working super hard in the study/work to win the competition in involution. After all, it is not your boss who makes you work overtime, but other people who are willing to work overtime; it is not the examination that makes you study hard, but other people who are willing to study; it is not the extracurricular tuition classes that put your child in these classes, but other parents who are willing to send their children to not the extracurricular tuition classes. However, in fact, "involuted kings" did not cause involution, but involution forces some people to become "involuted kings". Condemn on these people cannot create new extra resources nor set up a new extra resources distribution system, which, therefore, indicates its inability to solve involution.

So, is there no solution for involution? I believe it is critical to examine the deep cause for involution.

As Xiang (2020) argues, an important prerequisite for the involution of Chinese society today is that there is no differentiation, that everyone is chasing one similar goal. As discussed above, the key assumption of involution is the limited resources so that the classmates/colleges have to work harder to win the competition. In China, the high degree of homogeneity of the mainstream social values has led to the high degree of similarity of the good resources that people often seek, including being admitted to a good university, getting a high-paying job, and so on. The idea that being successful and living a good life is so constrained within being getting these good resources, which seems to have become the default and consistent concept of each Chinese young generation. Even if they don't want to go to work, they still hope that they or their descendants to have a car and a house with an annual salary of one million. This is our collective subconsciousness.

However, for an individual self, being in involution is extremely mentally and physically exhausted. We who are caught in it with a very confusing feeling. On the one hand, we hate involution, which creates a strong sense of anxiety, and on the other hand, we have to be a part of it to become successful.

Therefore, to break the involution, the whole society needs to break the subconsciousness of high-quality resources. Nowadays, if we do not pursue these high-quality resources, we will be worried and questioned by relatives and friends. The collective subconscious has become an invisible moral pressure that prevents us from quitting. We need to find a way to change everyone's values from only participating in extracurricular tuition classes can a student get into a good university, and only spending all energy in work can an office worker afford a car and house, to that it is not necessary to receive the best education or to get the highest-end cars and houses for one to live a good life. In short, the idea of moral betrayal described by Xiang (2020), where withdrawing from the competition is regarded as a kind of betrayal to parents, should not be encouraged.

To do this, it is not enough to change the values of a few individuals alone, while entrepreneurs obviously do not want employees to stop competing with each other to improve performance. Therefore, from my point of view, this change in mainstream social values must be implemented by the state or government.

From my observations, China's government is indeed doing something to adjust the mainstream social values as well as setting up new related resources-distribution mechanisms. An official document has just been published in the past few weeks, where the government is trying to reduce the marketization of education and limit the types and scale of extracurricular tuition classes. Although I personally do not support such severe restrictions on the large-scale extracurricular tutoring market at once, it can be seen that the state is looking for ways to reduce the occurrence of involution in Gaokao before China's higher education system getting big enough. For another example, real estate, an important factor that has caused countless workers to participate in involution, is also, under the deliberate regulation of the government, gradually losing its investment value. Hopefully, people will be no longer studying/working so hard for merely one goal, to be admitted into a good university or to get a higher-paid salary to buy a house.

In conclusion, from all these thoughts and questions, I show how harmful the involution could be and some possible exit mechanisms with the analysis of why or why not it could be working. Especially, I believe to overcome the society-level involution in China, the state and the government have to play a crucial part in it with their power to break the subconsciousness and change the mainstream social values.
